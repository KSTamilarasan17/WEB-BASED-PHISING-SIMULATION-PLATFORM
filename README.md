# WEB-BASED-PHISING-SIMULATION-PLATFORM

A Web-Based Phishing Simulation Platform designed to educate users and organizations about phishing attacks by simulating real-world phishing scenarios in a safe and controlled environment.
This project helps users identify phishing techniques, understand attacker behavior, and improve cybersecurity awareness.

# 📌 Project Overview

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats today. Many users fall victim due to lack of awareness and practical exposure.

This platform simulates realistic phishing scenarios such as:

Fake login pages

Fraudulent emails

Malicious links

Users can safely interact with these simulations and learn:

How phishing attacks work

How attackers steal credentials

How to identify and avoid phishing attempts

# 🎯 Objectives
